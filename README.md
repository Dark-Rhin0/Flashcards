# Flash Cards

This is a simple flash cards app that I created with sir AC Pelayo for our DOM/JavaScript project in __Kodigo Code Camp__. \
Its intended function is to help students memorize by providing them with an interactive platform where they can store and play with their learning materials.

__Tools Used:__
1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JavaScript
4. Fontawesome for the icons
