# Flash Cards

**Live URL:** https://jjdalaso.github.io/Flashcards/ \
\
This is a simple flash cards app that I created with sir AC Pelayo for our DOM/JavaScript project in __Kodigo Code Camp__. \
It's intended function is to help students memorize by providing them with an interactive platform where they can store and play with their learning materials.
\
\
The app can be used directly on any browser (_using the Live URL above_), and can also be saved on the phone as a web app to allow offline usage (_by following the instructions below_):
1. Using a mobile browser, open https://flashcard-js.web.app
2. Tap your browser settings (if you're using Chrome, it's the three vertical dots icon at the upper-right of your phone's screen) and then select __"Add to Homescreen"__
3. An option to add the web app to Home Screen will appear. Tap __Add__ to proceed.
4. Go to your phone's home screen and find the Flashcards app. Tap it to open it and start using it.

__Tools Used:__
1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JavaScript
4. Fontawesome for the icons
