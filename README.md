# FlashCard

**Live URL:** https://jjdalaso.github.io/Flashcards/ \

This is a simple Flashcard app that I created with sir AC Pelayo for our DOM/JavaScript project in Kodigo Code Camp. \
It's intended function is to help students memorize by providing them with an interactive platform where they can store and play with their learning materials.

The app can be used directly on any browser (_using the Live URL above_), and can also be saved on the phone as a web app to allow offline usage (_by following the instructions below_):\
1. Using a mobile browser, open https://flashcard-js.web.app
2. Tap your browser settings (if you're using Chrome, it's the three vertical dots icon at the upper-right of your phone's screen) and then select "Add to Homescreen"
3. An option to add the web app to Home Screen will appear. Tap Add to proceed.
4. Go to your phone's home screen and find the Flashcards app. Tap it to open it and start using it.
